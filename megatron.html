    <p> Megatron hates the human race, but he hates sad children even more. Many
      naughty children will call him the "fun" one. He enjoys destroying buildings with
      brute force and stealing technology from the different militaries of the world.
      His scary look helps to keep children from misbehaving in front of him as well
      as his very real threat of complete disintigration of anyone caught disobeying
      him.
