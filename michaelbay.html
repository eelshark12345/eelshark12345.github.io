    <p> Michael Bay is the brains, brawn, and looks of our daycare center. His
      charming good looks and silver tongue are enough to get any child to love him
      and enjoy their time with him to the fullest. He's won a Nobel prize for his
      amazing work on the Transfromers and TMNT franchises. He happily trains children
      in acting, demolitions, use of firearms, and how to make a lot of money
      from a bad product.</p>
