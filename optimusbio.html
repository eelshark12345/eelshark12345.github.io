    <p>Optimus Prime is not only the leader of the Autobots but he is also a
      loving babysitter. He can pick up and drop off children from school and is
      even willing to take kids on field trips to watch him battle the Decepticons.
      Despite his hard metal body he has a warm and soft heart of kidness, unless
      you're a Decepticon of course.</p>
