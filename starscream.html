    <p> Starscream is a hard believer in tough love. One look from him will put any child
      in their place. Just like Optimus, Starscream is able to give children rides
      to and from school and can teach them techniques for piloting military
      fighter jets. His hatred of Megatron and thirst for power make him a great
      addition to our daycare service.</p>
